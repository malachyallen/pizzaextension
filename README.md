# pizzaextension
This extension is for the game Hacknet (https://store.steampowered.com/app/365450/Hacknet).

I originally thought of this idea when I was on a channel in the official Hacknet_Extensions Discord Server (https://discord.gg/hacknet)
when some people (namely Smartie and Kwiper) joked about a pizza extension. Kwiper wanted to add a pizza-themed mission in Re:Try
but Smartie wanted to create an entire extension about pizza. I then decided I was going to beat Smartie to making and publishing it.

After some big errors, I finally got there (thanks Fayti1703!) and it is now published on NexusMods, Steam Workshop and GitHub!

Take that, Smartie!

Thanks for playing,

(okay, so I do have a kind of love-hate relationship with Smartie and Kwiper, but do check them out!)
