    <body>MESSAGE FOR '#PLAYERNAME#'
I've found the central backup server for what could be the end of pizza as we know it.
Go to the linked server, download the executable file in /bin/ and delete those files.
Just to be safe, I'll need you to delete the files in /sys/ on that server as well.
Remember to delete your logs!
