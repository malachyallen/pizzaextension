By Richard Schmidt



We've all eaten the 'perfect pizza', but that's just opinion. Everyone's been thinking it: 'When will someone make a pizza that EVERYONE likes?'.
Well, that question is answered today by PepperoniTech, a leading biotech company that has just released a patent to the public that could change how we make pizza. 'BioPizza' is created using a special machine no bigger than a 15-inch laptop, and looks like a regular cheese and tomato pizza but takes on the taste of whatever you want via input on the machine.



We'll report with an update to confirm more details soon, but for now, why not discuss this in the comments?
